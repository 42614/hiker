# Hiker
 App for tracking my hikes and equipment.

 # My first app.
This is a side quest in my thesis writing life where I try to build an app to track my hikes.

## Workflow for Creating the App

1. **Planning**
    - Define the app's features and requirements.
    - Create wireframes and mockups for the user interface.
    - Set up a project timeline and milestones.

2. **Setup Development Environment**
    - Install necessary development tools (e.g., IDE, version control).
    - Set up a repository on GitHub for version control.
    - Initialize the project with a suitable framework (e.g., React Native for mobile apps).

3. **Development**
    - Implement the user interface based on the mockups.
    - Develop the backend services (e.g., REST API, database).
    - Integrate frontend and backend components.
    - Write unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.

4. **Testing**
    - Perform thorough testing on different devices and platforms.
    - Fix bugs and optimize performance based on feedback.
    - Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with a small group of users.

5. **Deployment**
    - Prepare the app for deployment (e.g., build, package).
    - Deploy the app to app stores (e.g., Google Play, Apple App Store).
    - Monitor the app for any issues post-deployment and release updates as needed.

6. **Maintenance**
    - Regularly update the app with new features and improvements.
    - Monitor user feedback and address any issues promptly.
    - Keep dependencies and libraries up to date.


    ## Concrete Steps for Creating the App

    1. **Planning**
        - List the features you want in the app (e.g., track hikes, manage equipment).
        - Sketch the main screens of the app (e.g., home, hike details, equipment list).
        - Set deadlines for each feature.

    2. **Setup Development Environment**
        - Install Python and pip.
        - Set up a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`.
        - Activate the virtual environment:
            - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
            - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
        - Clone your GitHub repository: `git clone <your-repo-url>`.
        - Navigate to the project directory: `cd <your-repo-name>`.
        - Install necessary packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

    3. **Development**
        - Create the main modules: `home.py`, `hike_details.py`, `equipment_list.py`.
        - Set up a web framework (e.g., Flask or Django).
        - Implement the UI using a web framework or a GUI library (e.g., Tkinter).
        - Set up a backend service (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) to store hike and equipment data.
        - Connect the frontend to the backend using REST API calls.
        - Write tests for your modules and services.

    4. **Testing**
        - Test the app locally: `python -m unittest discover`.
        - Fix any bugs found during testing.
        - Gather feedback from a small group of users and make necessary adjustments.

    5. **Deployment**
        - Prepare the app for deployment (e.g., create a Docker container).
        - Deploy the app to a cloud service (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
        - Monitor the app for crashes and user feedback.

    6. **Maintenance**
        - Regularly check for updates to dependencies: `pip list --outdated`.
        - Implement new features based on user feedback.
        - Fix any reported bugs and release updates.
